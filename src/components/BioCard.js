        <p>
          My career in tech started in Portland Oregon with supporting Insurance CRM, training, and implementing clients.  I gained a mastery and love for the business of software.  Then I took a role on the Product team and continued contributing to future capabilities of the software platform.

          As a Product Owner, I exercised skills in agile project management, feature design, functional testing, and release management.   Later I continued to level up in UI/UX, product packaging and strategy, and handling all forms of communications.  Through it all, my highest appreciation was for engineers who produced the software. This led me to consider a major career change towards software engineering.

          To validate my intentions in this career pivot, I interviewed several developers that I have worked with to gain additional perspective and brainstorm ideas for coding camps. During this time I began self-paced courses in web development in order to fully confirm that I would enjoy the challenge of coding. After 6 weeks of working full-time and teaching myself JavaScript basics at night, I felt confident to take the leap into Software Development.

          I enrolled in a 12-week full-time Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly. My daily routine was a vigorous experience of long work days at the computer, coding, studying, planning, and presenting projects. I created many applications in JavaScript, React, along with other technologies.  However, the big picture of my experience was to become an excellent problem solver and systematic planner.

          Post Graduation, I continued to receive Professional support from General Assembly's coaches, to further prepare me for job-seeking, networking, and creating effective Portfolio materials. A typical day usually involves enhancing project features, researching a new technical skill, connecting with other professionals in my network, and reaching out to hiring managers about exciting opportunities.
